Default of credit card clients to the Pattern Recognition course (Fall 2017). TEC de Monterrey

To access the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients

In this work I try to estimate the default payment of credit card clients according to the raw data description (link above) with 4 differents techniques:
-Multidimensional linear regression
-Neural Network
-kNN
-Support vector machine (linear kernel)

This work begins with a data analysis.
